    "text": "The subject of blockchain, which can be chosen as a subject-specific compulsory elective module at the Faculty of Computer Science/Mathematics, provides an insight into the topic of digital currencies. The history is also briefly discussed, but above all the technical side is dealt with quickly. The division into block courses enables students to develop a deeper understanding, sometimes in teams with several fellow students. The programming aspect of the subject creates a highly interesting seminar in which both crypto enthusiasts and conventional software developers get their money's worth. With his open and direct manner, Hendrik Ebbers creates a relaxed but productive working atmosphere in which students enjoy actively participating and contributing to the seminar. Personally, I really enjoyed the subject despite initially having fewer technical points of contact. I would make the same choice again."
