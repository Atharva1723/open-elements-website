Welcome to my Blog. In the next time I will write here about my open source projects and UI stuff in Java. My first project, the JGrid, is released in Version 0.1 at [google code](https://code.google.com/p/jgrid/).

- Test 1
- Test 2

The JGrid is a gui-component for the visualization in a grid. Here are 2 Screenshots from my JGrid-demos (click at them to start the demos):
