As shown in [the sneak peek last week]({{< ref "/posts/2014-06-10-sneak-peek-aerofx" >}}) a new JavaFX theme is in development. [Matthias Meidinger](http://sigpwr.de) is creating this skin as part of his bachelor thesis and since the last week he made some big improvements. So I think it's time for a new preview of the upcoming JavaFX theme. The following pics show dialogs that use the __AeroFX__ skin:

Currently all the animations for focused controls and custom SVG parts like the check mark for checkboxes are in development. Once this parts are done I will post a new update. We hope you like this work ;)
