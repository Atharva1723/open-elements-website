Maybe some of you have seen the presentation of the new AppleTV. Apple always creates awesome UIs and for the new AppleTV the introduced an unique way how icons can be displayed: Layered Images.

By layering images a 3D look is created. This looks very cool and I can't wait to test this new feature.

Since I have to wait 1 more month I started to recreate the effect by using JavaFX today. With some math, transition, perspective transformation and shadows I created a JavaFX demo that copies this new icon visualization. I will blog later how this is done in detail. But I like my current results that much that I want to share them with you ;)

Here is a first preview (and yes I only used JavaFX to create this):
