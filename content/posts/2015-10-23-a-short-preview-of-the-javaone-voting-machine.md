Voting Machine devices will be placed in every room at JavaOne. By doing so attendees can directly vote for each session and the voting results will be shown on a central leaderboard.

Currently [Michael Heinrichs](https://twitter.com/net0pyr) and I manufacture and test all the devices in Silicon Valley and hope to have all of them finished with the beginning of the next week :)
