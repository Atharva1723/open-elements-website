Since MacOS has some special Controls that are not in JavaFX out-of-the-box, I started to add some of them, which will be available when using AquaFX.

Here are some of them:

You can see some a HelpButton, a different rounded Variant for Buttons, a ShareButton and a GroupBox.

There are many more of them on my queue.

So with those Buttons, you can start to make neat dialogs without any pain. This can result in:

or:

![date-and-time-demo](/posts/guigarage-legacy/date-and-time-demo.png)

The SearchField is still missing, but since it is used so often in Mac OS in definitely will get this done, too. Just didn't want to keep back some results from you.

My next blogpost will be about some useful HOW-TOs, I had to find out to go on, e.g. "How do I make Toolbars working together with the top of the dialog?" "How to make MenuBar showing on top in MacOS Menu?". So keep on visiting us.
