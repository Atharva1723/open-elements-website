Yesterday I gave a [Vagrant-Binding]({{< ref "/posts/2012-11-01-introducing-vagrant-binding" >}}) presentation at [JUG Dortmund](http://www.jugdo.de/?p=75). I received really great feedback and thanks to some productive discussions the future of the API is getting more clearly to me. You can download the slides of the talk [here](http://de.slideshare.net/HendrikEbbers/vagrant-puppet-jug-2). The German jaxenter has published an [article about Vagrant-Binding](http://it-republik.de/jaxenter/artikel/Einweg-VM-zur-Runtime-erstellen-5516.html) today. So it seems that there are really people out there wanting to use this stuff. Thanks for all the positive feedback and support.
