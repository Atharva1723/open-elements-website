The Gesture Wrapper API is a wrapper around the Apple multitouch gestures API. It enables you to work with gesture listeners in any swing application without caring for platform-dependence.

You can download the jar and documentation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/projects/gesture-wrapper.md %}).

I posted a short [tutorial]({{< ref "/posts/2011-08-04-preview-multitouch-gestures-in-swing" >}}).
