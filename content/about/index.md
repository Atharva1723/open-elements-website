Hendrik Ebbers founded the OpenElements GmbH in 2022 to create a company that strengthens open source and open collaboration with a strong focus on the Java ecosystem.

## Our Founder

Hendrik Ebbers is a Java Champion, a member of JSR expert groups, and a JavaOne Rockstar. He has achieved all this through his belief in open source and communities. Hendrik is the founder and leader of the Java User Group Dortmund and gives talks and presentations in user groups and at conferences worldwide. Hendrik is a member of the Jakarta WG and the Adoptium WG. In both projects, he was already involved before they became Eclipse working groups: Hendrik was a member of the AdoptOpenJDK TSC and part of the Java Bean Validation expert group.

Next to Eclipse-related projects, Hendrik contributes to other OSS. For example, Hendrik is a core committer of the Hedera Hashgraph, the only open source public ledger written in Java. Here, Hendrik helps Hedera and SwirldsLabs create secure, fast, and reliable components using open source standards, components, and well-known workflows.

## Our Engagements

We are Contributing Members of the Eclipse foundation: The Eclipse Foundation is a crucial player in the open source ecosystem that allows individual open source enthusiasts and companies – big or small – to work together at eye level by providing centralized and independent management for open source projects. We contribute to the foundation and its projects.

We are a member of the Adoptium Working Group: For the Java ecosystem, Adoptium is one of the essential top-level projects in the Eclipse foundation since it provides free and enterprise-ready LTS versions of Java. 

We are a member of AdoptOpenJDK: While the Temurin binaries have been migrated to the Adoptium Working Group, the idea to provide vendor-independent and free-to-use Java binaries has been started in AdoptOpenJDK. We are part of the project and have a seat on the technical steering committee (TCS).

We are a member of the JakartaEE Working Group: We already contributed to Java enterprise specs before JavaEE was moved to the Eclipse foundation and became JakartaEE. The move to the Eclipse foundation was quite positive since the standards for enterprise Java can now be defined in a 100% vendor-independent environment.

We are a member of the OSPO Alliance: Open source has become such an essential part of most IT departments that establishing an open source program office (OSPO) is a critical step for companies today. Within the OSPO Alliance, we share our knowledge to define best practices and structures to establish open source program offices.

We are a member of the JCP and expert groups: The Java Community Process (JCP) is the formalized process to define new standards and specifications for Java in so-called Java Specification Requests (JSRs). We are part of the working group of several JSRs and, for example, helped to standardize the Java Bean Validation.

We are a sponsor of the Wikimedia Foundation: Open collaboration is an essential aspect of our lives, and Wikipedia is the best known example for such collaboration. Therefore, we sponsor the Wikimedia foundation monthly to support this critical project.

We are a sponsor of several small Open Source libraries: Today, mostly all software depends on open source components. But unfortunately, such parts are often not recognized or analyzed. Therefore, critical software may depend on a component that is not maintained anymore or only by a handful of individual people. We support such projects by using GitHub sponsorship.

## Our Customers & Partners
