## Our Founder

Hendrik Ebbers (@hendrikEbbers) is a Java Champion, JSR expert group member and JavaOne Rockstar.

In 2022 Hendrik founded OpenElements to positively impact open source software and the open source community. The main goal of OpenElements is to strengthen open collaboration. For Hendrik, this includes helping companies to use and introduce more OSS by supporting them to set up an open source programming office (OSPO) or providing custom consulting for open source projects like Eclipse Adoptium.

Based on his commitment in open source and his work in Eclipse working groups like Adoptium and JakartaEE Hendrik became member of the Eclipse Foundation Board of Directors in 2023.
Next to Eclipse-related projects, Hendrik contributes to other OSS. He is a core committer of the Hedera Hashgraph, the only open source public ledger written in Java. Here, Hendrik helps Hedera and SwirldsLabs create secure, fast, and reliable components using open source standards, components, and well-known workflows.
